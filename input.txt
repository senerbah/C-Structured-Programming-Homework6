Hello World! This file is intentionally created to test the character counting program.
The goal is to include many sentences, multiple words, repeated letters, and various cases.
Bahtinur Sener is practicing C programming for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.
This is Homework 6, and the task is about reading a file and counting each character properly.

C language provides functions such as fgetc, fopen, fclose, fprintf, and many others.
When writing systems-level code, C offers fine-grained control over memory and operations.
Learning how to handle files, text processing, and arrays is an essential skill.
Ege University International Computer Institute provides courses that support these abilities.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This famous English pangram contains every letter from A to Z at least once.
Typing such sentences helps check whether the character counting algorithm works correctly.
Another example of a pangram is: "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."

Machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, and pattern recognition
are modern fields that heavily rely on algorithms, mathematics, and strong programming skills.
Although this exercise is simple, understanding how character counting works
is the foundation for more advanced text processing techniques.

Below are some repeated lines, alphabet sequences, and random text
to ensure the file is long enough for a comprehensive test.

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Line 1: Testing, testing, testing...
Line 2: Counting characters should be accurate.
Line 3: Make sure uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same.
Line 4: LETTERS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE LOWERCASED.
Line 5: letters like this should also be counted properly.

Random text block:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
cccccccccccccccccccccccccc

Programming in C can be fun and also challenging.
Bahtınur is improving her skills every day.

More sentences for length: 
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Better late than never.
Actions speak louder than words.
Practice makes perfect.
Knowledge is power.
The early bird catches the worm.
No pain, no gain.

Even more filler text to increase the size of this input file:
This line adds more content.
So does this line.
And this one.
And another one.
And yet another one.
We keep adding more and more lines.
C programming assignments often require careful debugging.
File handling is one of the core parts of system-level programming.
Character counting helps build intuition about ASCII values and loops.

Nearly done — adding some more:
aaaa bbbb cccc dddd eeee ffff gggg hhhh

Final lines:
This is the end of the input file.
Character counting should now produce meaningful results.
Thank you for reading this long input text file!
